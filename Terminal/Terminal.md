# Terminal 


        The terminal, console, shell, and kernel are fundamental components of an operating system that help users interact with a computer. Together, they connect user commands to system hardware through layers of software and interfaces.

- ### Terminal: 
    A text-based interface where users type commands and receive output from the system.
- ### Console: 
    The physical or virtual device that provides access for input and output operations.
- ### Shell:
    A command-line interpreter that translates user commands into actions performed by the operating system.
- ### Kernel: 
    The core part of the operating system that manages hardware resources like memory, CPU, and devices.
